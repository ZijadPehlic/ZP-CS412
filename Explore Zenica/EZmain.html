Illyrian, Roman Municipium Bistua Nuova (2nd–4th century; old name of the city) with early Christian dual basilica. 
Traces of an ancient settlement have been found here as well; villa rustica, thermae, a temple and other buildings
were present too. Earliest findings in the place date from the period 3,000–2,000 B.C.; they were found on the

Zenica's current name was first mentioned in 1415. Time of the independence 
of the Medieval Bosnia is directly connected to Zenica (Gradješa's plate and abdication act; Kulin ban's time; 
Vranduk, a castle of the Bosnian kings; Janjići and 'hižas' [homes] of the Bosnian Church members; stećci, stone 
tombstone monuments etc.). During the Ottoman rule (1463–1878), Zenica became a Muslim town (kasaba); at the very
