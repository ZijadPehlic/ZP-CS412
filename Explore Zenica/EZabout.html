<h1>About author</h1>

<h3>
Hello! My name is Zijad Pehlic and I am author of Explore Zenica. As you may guess, I come frome Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina
I am studying Software Engineering at International university of Sarajevo. I enjoy everything related to programming 
such as developing web applications. This particular application is a project for my Web Application Development course.
Making this webpage was really joyful and also, it has made me remember why I love my city of Zenica so much.
</h3>
<h2>
Why make this page?
</h2>
<h3>
Zenica is my home town, and also beatiful place with amazing sites to see. It is sorrounded by beatiful nature
and great people. As a citizen of this wonderful city, I believe that it deserves web page of this type. 
People from all around the world are able to get preview of why they should visit Zenica. Many tourists visit 
Sarajevo every year and don't know what beauty lays just above 30 min ride to Zenica. This webpage could attract 
them, but also attract all of the tourists that don't know about this beautiful coutry of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and it's town Zenica. As proud cizen of Zenica, I believe that this webpage could be my way of saying thank you to
Zenica for everything that it has given tome.
