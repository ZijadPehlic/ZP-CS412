Bistričak; A mountain resort north of Zenica at the confluence of the Ograjina and Šerićka rivers, which form the
 river Bistričak, below the steep slopes of the Velja mountain massif (1125 m / m). The name most probably comes 
from the name of the river Bistričak, which was named after the village of Bistrica, which is located in a hilly 
and mountainous area, near the confluence with Bosnia.
The Austro-Hungarian occupation brought progress to the rural area of ​​Dogloda, where Bistričak is located.
Around 1922, a mountain lodge was built, owned by the "Friend of Nature" society. Before World War II, the home 
was turned into a hotel. It burned down during World War II. After II S.R. the Ironworks decided to build a resort
. The workers of the Ironworks were on the construction of the resort. The ground floor was built of stone, and 
the two floors were made of mountain-style logs. The grand opening was in the summer of 1949. Unfortunately, the 
home burned down in 1950. It was renovated in 1952. and later reconstructed and extended several times. At the 
beginning of the eighties, a 400 m annex was built. upstream along Šerićka Rijeka. Apart from the Ironworks, rest 
homes in Bistričak were built by TP "Progres" and scouts from Zenica. Bistricak today is grat piece of nature where
people from Zenica come to relax. There are football, basketball and volleyball courts for sports activities.
